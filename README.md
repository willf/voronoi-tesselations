This interactive visualization displays points generated by the function f(x) = (44x³ + 22x² + 11x) mod 256. For each point, a Voronoi region (or cell) is drawn. Each Voronoi region contains all points on the plane that are closer to its associated data point than to any other data point.

The regions are colored based on their area, allowing you to visually identify larger and smaller areas within the tessellation. You can change the function parameters, toggle the visibility of the original points, adjust the border line width, and select different color schemes to explore unique patterns.
